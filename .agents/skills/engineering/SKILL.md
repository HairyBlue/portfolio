## Suite Directory & Child Skills

| Skill Name | Description & When to Activate | Child Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`api-design`** | RESTful modeling, RFC 7807 problem details, idempotency keys, keyset pagination, and HMAC webhook reliability. | [`api-design/SKILL.md`](api-design/SKILL.md) |

| **`prototype`** | Rapid throwaway HTML/UI prototypes to validate state and interaction design before production code. | [`prototype/SKILL.md`](prototype/SKILL.md) |
| **`refactoring`** | Fowler refactoring catalog, green-to-green invariant, Two-Hats rule, guard clauses, extract method, polymorphism, and strangler fig. | [`refactoring/SKILL.md`](refactoring/SKILL.md) |

| **`tdd`** | Strict test-driven development red-green-refactor loop. | [`tdd/SKILL.md`](tdd/SKILL.md) |
| **`to-spec`** | Synthesizes active architectural conversations into an actionable specification. | [`to-spec/SKILL.md`](to-spec/SKILL.md) |
| **`to-tickets`** | Breaks any plan or spec into tracer-bullet tickets with explicit blocking edges. | [`to-tickets/SKILL.md`](to-tickets/SKILL.md) |
| **`wizard`** | Generates an interactive CLI bash wizard for manual human tasks (cloud setup, secrets). | [`wizard/SKILL.md`](wizard/SKILL.md) |
| **`zero-downtime-migrations`** | 5-phase Expand/Contract pattern, online index creation, lock timeouts, and batched non-locking backfills. | [`zero-downtime-migrations/SKILL.md`](zero-downtime-migrations/SKILL.md) |
